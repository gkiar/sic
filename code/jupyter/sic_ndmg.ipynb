    "The first step of ndmg turns 'raw' Nifti images into connectomes. The cell below executes the first step of the pipeline on a demo subject. The subject has been heavily downsampled for this computational demonstration, which may produce non-neurofidelic results.\n",

    "In order to run the code, click anywhere on the code below, and press the \"play\" button in the menu bar above (between down arrow and square). An indication that it is running is that an asterisk will appear on the left hand side of the cell. Don't panic if you don't see anything immediately, running the cell below should take 3-4 minutes. When execution is completed you'll notice a wall of text appear below the code.\n",
