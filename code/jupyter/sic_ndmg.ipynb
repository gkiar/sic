    "N.B. the command below is more complicated in appearance than that documented elsewhere, which is because downsampling the data to produce a fast-running demo required new atlases and labels to be generated, which can normally be inferred by the pipeline.\n",

An indication that it is running is that an asterisk will appear on the left hand side of the cell. Don't panic if you don't see anything immediately, running the cell below should take 3-4 minutes."
